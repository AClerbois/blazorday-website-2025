# Code of Conduct

## Repository Contributor Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## BlazorDay Event Code of Conduct

### Event Behavior Policy

BlazorDay is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive event experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category.

### Expected Behavior

We expect all participants in the BlazorDay event to:

- Treat all participants with respect and consideration
- Communicate openly, with respect for others, critiquing ideas rather than individuals
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants
- Alert event organizers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress

### Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any form
- Physical, written, verbal or other abuse
- Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Threatening or stalking any participant
- Disruption of talks or other events
- Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior

### Consequences

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including expulsion from the event without warning or refund.

### Reporting

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify an event organizer as soon as possible. Event staff can be identified by their special badges and will help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe for the duration of the event.
